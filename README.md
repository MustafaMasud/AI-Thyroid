# AI-Thyroid-Detector

## Description
### Objective :dart:
To accurately predict, on the basis of patient symptoms and blood measurements, the existence of thyroid diseases and abnormalities.

### Result & Conclusion :trophy:
The model can predict with 94% accuracy and 88% precision the existence of thyroid disease and abnormality on the basis of demographic and blood information. The model is best used for the early detection of thyroid issues through positive prediction.

## Data Set :pencil:
The data for this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmanuelfwerr/thyroid-disease-data?resource=download). The dataset is an aggregation of the databases made available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository available [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/thyroid+disease). 

## Installation and execution steps :battery:
#### 1. The Python file/IPYNB can be run using Python 3 or above.
#### 2. The IPYNB file can be run by pressing the 'Run All' button. It will be helpful to install Jupyter Notebook extension from the VSCode store if using VSCode.
#### 3. Ensure that scikit-learn is installed on the device:
```pip install -U scikit-learn```
```python LogisticRegression.py```
